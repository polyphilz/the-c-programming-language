# Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

## Exercises

1-1. Run the `"hello, world"` program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

Done. I didn't leave any of the errors in though. See: `hello.c`.

1-2. Experiment to find out what happens when `printf`'s argument string contains `\c`, where `c` is some character not listed above.

I used `\z` and got an "unknown escape sequence" error.
