# The C Programming Language - Exercise Solutions & Notes

Someone I look up to in the CS education community once said that he believed all software engineers should work through this book in it's entirety. I bought the book that same day and set a goal to work through every exercise, making my solutions and any associated notes available publicly as per the public learning philosophy I subscribe to. I started on April 19th, 2020, and concluded my goal on __IN PROGRESS__.
